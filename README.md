## COVID-19 Cases Canada Neural Network
Data has been extracted from Canada Covid database website and after cleaning, Deep Neural Network has been performed with three different models. Model hyperparameters has been trained with validation set and best parameters (epoch and batch size) has been taken for all 3 models. Processing and Testing time of all three models have been accessed and appropriate model has been choosen for prediction.
